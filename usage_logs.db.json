Oyo State v. A.G. Federation) were not specifically used to determine the suitability of pro bono services. Instead, they established the fundamental right to legal aid and the constitutional duty of the government to provide legal aid to indigent persons.\n\nHowever, these cases can be used to support the argument that pro bono services are essential for ensuring access to justice and upholding the rule of law. By providing pro bono services, lawyers can help bridge the gap between the rich and the poor, ensuring that everyone has equal access to legal representation and the opportunity to have their voices heard.\n\nIn that sense, the cases can be seen as supporting the importance of pro bono work, including the provision of legal aid to indigent persons.",
